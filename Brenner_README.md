CSE210 -- Programming with Classes

WHile Elizeu uses a dealer imported from a public library, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make mine own for the purposes of this assignment.  

My program uses two lists, one filled with the numbers 1-13, and another that is empty.  from that point, the file is simple.  using a WHILE loop, every time the loop "draws" a card, or a random number from the first list, it removes that number from the list and instead adds it to the second list.  The WHILE Loop will finish either when the user asks it to, when the points reach zero, or when the first list has nothing in it.
